# Welcome to Libadwaita
Slides for my FOSDEM 2022 talk about Libadwaita

## Abstract
GTK4 is finally ready for production, and with it comes Libadwaita, the next generation of the GNOME app development platform. This new library builds on what Libhandy did for GTK3 but takes it even further, streamlining many of the most common things app developers need to build great apps for GNOME, across both desktop and mobile.

This includes standardized patterns and widgets for basic layout elements like lists and cards, adaptive navigation, touch/touchpad gestures, easier ways of using color in apps, and much more.

This talk will give a quick overview of the current capabilities of the platform, and show how app developers are making use of it to build apps that work well on computers of all shapes and sizes.
